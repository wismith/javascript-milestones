## Instructions

The snippets you write for each group of tasks can go in as many files as you'd like, but avoid putting everything in one giant file. It will make it hard for you to figure out what's going on.

There's no particular format or requirement. This isn't an assignment. It's a study guide. You need to make it work for you. If you're spending time thinking about how ***I*** want it formatted then you're missing the point!

We'll be sharing everyone's snippet after this is over, so write with that audience in mind. Be nice to your classmates. See the [Demonstrations](#demonstrations) section below for what helpful demonstrations look like.

You're free to use any built-in JavaScript function unless otherwise stated. For example, if you're asked to write a function that works like `Math.max`, don't use `Math.max`!

When you find a task you're not sure how to do, search for documentation, tutorials, guides, or anything else that might help you.

If you copy code from somewhere else, include the URL in a comment.

### Demonstrations

One of the tasks below is to use the `+` operator on two variables containing numbers and explain what that represents. Imagine you were writing something that served as a miniature tutorial for your other classmates. Both running the code and reading the code should reinforce how to use `+` and what it represents.

#### Helpful Demonstration <!-- omit in toc -->

When writing your demonstration, remember that people will be interacting with it in two ways:

1. Running the file and reading any output
1. Reading the code itself to make sense of the output

Here's a helpful demonstration:

```javascript
let num1 = 50;
let num2 = -76;

console.log('The value of num1 is:', num1);
console.log('The value of num2 is:', num2);
console.log('The sum of num1 and num2 is:', num1 + num2);
```

Someone who ran this code first would see a bunch of output. Once they opened the code, they'd be able to see which line of code produced the output they just saw. They'd be able to play with the values and see the output change in a useful way.

#### Unhelpful Demonstration <!-- omit in toc -->

This demonstration is much less helpful:

```javascript
let num1 = 50;
let num2 = -76;

console.log(num1);
console.log(num2);
console.log(num1 + num2);
```

While this code uses `+`, the output will be nothing but a column of numbers. What do those numbers mean? How do we know which line of output corresponds to which line of code? How can someone unfamiliar with `+` make predictions about how the output would change if they changed the values of `num1` and `num2`?

### Iteration / Looping

You will probably want to create more than one file to demonstrate everything below. Try to use one loop per task. Imagine your demonstrations being used in some online tutorial; a single loop that demonstrates 20 things will be confusing.

#### Looping With Numbers

You should be able to do the following using a loop:

- [ ] Iterate over the `daysInMonth` object from the [Objects](#objects) section, printing out the name of every month that has `31` days.

### Logical Operators

In a file called `logic.js`, you should be able to do the following:

- [ ] Declare two numbers `num1` and `num2`. Print a one message if both are even, a different message if only one is even, and a third message if neither are even.
- [ ] Write code that makes use of the following logical operators:
  - [ ] `||`
  - [ ] `&&`
  - [ ] `!`

### Functions

In a file called `functions.js`, you should be able to define and call the following functions with some relevant example inputs. If they return a value but don't print anything, you should be able to print what they return.

- [ ] A function `greet` that takes in a string representing someone's first name and prints out a greeting. The greeting can be anything, but it should contain the given name.
- [ ] A function called `hotOrCold` that takes a number as input and returns:
    1. `'hot'` if the number is greater than `100`
    1. `'correct'` if the number is exactly `100`
    1. `'cold'` if the number is less than `100`
- [ ] A function `add` that takes two numbers as input and returns (not prints) their sum.
  - [ ] A function `sum` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns their sum (using the `add` function you defined above)
- [ ] A function `larger` that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two (don't use the built-in `Math.max` function)
  - [ ] A function `largest` that takes an array of numbers as input an returns the largest in the array (using the function `larger` you defined above)
- [ ] A function `longer` that takes two strings as input and returns the longer of the two
  - [ ] A function `longest` that takes an array of strings as input and returns the longest string in the array (using the `longer` function you defined above)
- [ ] A function `reverse` that takes an array as input and returns a new array containing the same elements as the input array, but in reverse order (don't use the build-in `reverse()` function)
- [ ] A function `isChicagoPhoneNumber` that takes an array of US phone numbers as input and returns true if the area code is 773, 312, or 872. The phone numbers are strings that look like `'XXX-YYY-ZZZZ'`.
- [ ] A function `letterCounts` that takes a string as an input and returns an object whose keys are the letters in the string and whose values are the number of times a particular letter appears.

### File I/O

Create a file called `data.txt` that contains a few dozen random lines of varying length. Paste some song lyrics into the file, maybe.

In a file called `files.js`, you should be able to do the following:

- [ ] Read the contents of `data.txt` into a string
- [ ] Create an array containing one entry per line
- [ ] Print the longest and shortest lines in `data.txt`

## Understanding Code Like A Computer

Computers don't care what names we use to represent the work we want them to carry out. A function that adds two numbers could be called `mork`, `bananapeel`, or anything else. We only call it `add` because it helps *us*. The same goes for the code inside the function body.

Below are three functions whose names have nothing to do with the work they perform. You should be able to figure out what each function does.

Definitely read the code and try to make sense of it that way, but also copy the poorly-named code into an environment where you can experiment with it. Call the functions with different inputs to figure out what it's doing.

```javascript
function papaya(meow) {
  let x = meow[0];

  for (let zork = 0; zork < meow.length; zork++) {
    let potato = meow[zork];

    if (potato > x) {
      x = potato;
    }
  }

  return x;
}

console.log(papaya([10, -10, 40, 50, 108, 17]))
```

```javascript
function clowntown(octopus) {
  if (octopus < 0) {
    return -1 * octopus;
  } else {
    return octopus;
  }
}

console.log('clowntown(20) is:', clowntown(20));
console.log('clowntown(-20) is:', clowntown(-20));
console.log('clowntown(0) is:', clowntown(0));
console.log('clowntown(-108) is:', clowntown(-108));
```

```javascript
function chowhound(llama) {
  let razzleDazzle = [];

  for (let qq = 1; qq <= llama.length; qq++) {
    razzleDazzle.push(llama[llama.length - qq]);
  }

  return razzleDazzle;
}

console.log(chowhound(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']));
```
